- refactor the components (Namings are confusing and code dups exist)
- header moving up
- refactor and move content to translation and the urls etc to Config
- create 404 page
- add link to compliance documents and enhance the busy styling
- hide scrollbar in the menu (on open there is a scrollbar flickering) - totally hide it
- move all constants into config/constants
- move all types into config/types
- What We Create - for this section we should be handling the mobile view in a way all the buttons are next to each other - maybe icons should be used or what?
